# Convolutional Neural Network Visualization and Style Transfer

This project has two main parts. The first part explores the use of different types of saliency methods, which provide insight into the decision-making processes of image
convolutional networks (CNNs). The second part involves using gradient manipulation techniques to extract the content and style from different images and combine them to
produce creative works.
